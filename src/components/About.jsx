          Welcome to ChemDye Scientific Illustrations, a studio dedicated to
          visual science communication, where art and science merge seamlessly.
          Iâ€™m Mariana Oksdath, the creator behind ChemDye. With over a decade of
          experience as a researcher in academia and the privilege of working
          with prestigious names like Greenpeace in design, I have found my
          passion in creating visuals that revolutionise how we perceive
          science.

          I firmly believe in the power of visuals to convey complex scientific
          concepts, and that belief drives my mission. I am driven by the desire
          to make visual science communication more widely recognised and
          appreciated. I am methodical in my approach, constantly seeking
          inspiration from my colleagues and surroundings and infusing my love
          for art into every project.

          Collaborating with scientists who have captivating stories to tell is
          my true calling. I excel at conceptualising ideas and transforming
          them into memorable images that leave a lasting impact. Colours,
          typography, design, light, and shadows constantly occupy my thoughts,
          as I believe I was born to fulfil this artistic role.
