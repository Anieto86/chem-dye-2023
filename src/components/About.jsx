            Welcome to ChemDye Scientific Illustrations, a studio dedicated to
            visual science communication, where art and science merge
            seamlessly. Iâ€™m Mariana Oksdath, the creator behind ChemDye. With
            over a decade of experience as a researcher in academia and the
            privilege of working with prestigious names like Greenpeace in
            design, I have found my passion in creating visuals that
            revolutionise how we perceive science.

            I firmly believe in the power of visuals to convey complex
            scientific concepts, and that belief drives my mission. I am driven
            by the desire to make visual science communication more widely
            recognised and appreciated. I am methodical in my approach,
            constantly seeking inspiration from my colleagues and surroundings
            and infusing my love for art into every project.

            Collaborating with scientists who have captivating stories to tell
            is my true calling. I excel at conceptualising ideas and
            transforming them into memorable images that leave a lasting impact.
            Colours, typography, design, light, and shadows constantly occupy my
            thoughts, as I believe I was born to fulfil this artistic role.
